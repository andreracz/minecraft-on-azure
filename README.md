This is a repository teaching how to run Minecraft on Azure
===========================================================

Initially there is only a sample, for running Vanilla Minecraft on Azure Container Instances. If enough people like it, I will create a few more samples, for running modded versions, and maybe running it on AKS as well.

To run it, just create a deployment on azure from a template, pointing it to the compiled arm template available, tweak the parameters, and you are done! Don't forget to accept the EULA, as it will crash the server if you don't.
